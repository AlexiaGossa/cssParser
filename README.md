A small CSS parser project in C, abandoned but left as is.

This small project is also capable of parsing HTML.
Although simple and incomplete, it already provided a good foundation for another, much larger project intended for embedded applications.

This code is provided for educational and research purposes only.
It is left as is.

Happy reading and happy testing.
